# CS312_Raytracer
A raytracer written in C for CSCI312 in the Fall of 2016 @ W&amp;M

The program can be compiled with the command: gcc rc.c vec.c –lm –o rc


The program can be executed with the command: ./rc < spheres.txt > img.ppm

Two example "sphere" text files are included in the appropriately named folder (though without lighting they're just circles...)

Disclaimer: If you're a CSCI312 student looking at this, please don't copy my code. You're better than that. I have no clue if CSCI312 still uses this project anyways.
